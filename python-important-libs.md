## Data Extractor library in python 
https://www.singer.io/#what-it-is

Singer describes how data extraction scripts—called “taps” —and data loading  
 scripts—called “targets”— should communicate, allowing them to be used in any   
 combination to move data from any source to any destination. Send data between   
 databases, web APIs, files, queues, and just about anything else you can think of.
